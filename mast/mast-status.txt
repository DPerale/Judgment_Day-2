                       MAST Status File
                       ----------------
Version 1.3.7.8
---------------

This version eliminates many bugs in the graphical editor for MAST,
which is now considered a "beta" version, still under development.

Version 1.3.7.5
---------------

This version introduces basic support for the following new modelling elements:

          - add the RT_EP network driver

          - add the "message_partitioning" attribute
              - add a restriction to check the message sizes if the
                message_partitioning attribute is not set

          - add the RTA_Overhead_Model attribute

However, we still need to change the schedulability analysis tools to
take into account these new model elements. This will be released in
version 1.3.8.

An "alpha" version of a graphical editor for MAST models is also
provided with this version (gmasteditor). It should only be used for
preliminary evaluation purposes, as it is known to have bugs that may
actually destroy the model being edited. We expect version 1.3.8 of
MAST to provide a stable version of this tool.


Version 1.3.7
-------------

This version introduces the new xml input format, with conversion
programs from the original text format to xml and bak. Three XML
schemas are created to describe MAST elements:

   Mast_Model.xsd : described the format of a MAST model
   Mast_Result.xsd: describes the format of the results of a MAST 
                    analysis tool
   Mast_Trace.xsd:  describes the format of a trace results file coming 
                    out from the Mast_Sim simulator.

Version 1.3.6
-------------

  This version introduces the hierarchical schedulers in the real-time
  model. It does so by separating from the old "processing_resource"
  model the concept of the primary scheduler, and by defining another
  object, the secondary scheduler, which van run on any desired
  scheduler through a scheduling server. See the mast model
  documentation for additional information.

  This version also introduces earliest deadline first (EDF)
  schedulers and the stack resource protocol (SRP) synchronization
  policy for shared objects.

  Several new analysis tools are introduced:
    - EDF_Monoprocessor_Analysis
          For single processor systems with and EDF scheduler (also
          supporting fixed priority interrupts)

    - EDF_Within_Priorities_Analysis
          For systems with a fixed priority primary scheduler and one
          or more EDF secondary schedulers

    - Deadline Assignment
          For EDF tasks, it assigns the scheduling deadlines equal to
          the deadlines specified as timing requirements, and assigns
          the task preemption levels according to the correrct order
          (by deadline minus release jitter in reverse order)

  In this version we have improved the offset_based analysis, using
  the results of Ola Redell in his thesis

Other minor changes:

    - Change the graphical gmast tool driver and the results
      viewer to GtkAda 2.x

    - Introduce additional restrictions to be used in the new tools:
                  - EDF_Only
                  - EDF_Within_Priorities_Only
                  - Flat_FP_Or_EDF_Only
                  - PCP_SRP_Or_Priority_Inheritance_Only
                  - SRP_Only
                  - SRP_Or_PCP_Only

    - Change the names of some tools:
               Offset_Based_Unoptimized_Analysis
                   => Offset_Based_Analysis
               Offset_Based_Analysis
                   => Offset_Based_Optimized_Analysis
               Linear_Simulated_Annealing_Priority_Assignment
                   => Linear_Simulated_Annealing_Assignment
               Multiple_Event_Simulated_Annealing_Priority_Assignment
                   => Multiple_Event_Simulated_Annealing_Assignment
               Calculate_Ceilings_For_PCP_Resources
                   => Calculate_Ceilings_And_Levels
         
    - Make the processor and network be abstract types and
      create a concrete Regular_Processor and Packet_Based_Network

    - Allow driver scheduling servers to be referenced by name

    - Allow network operations to specify time as number of bytes

    - Changed the processor, network and scheduler overheads from
      the Time type to Normalized_Execution_Time

    - Show the system schedulability status in the results
      viewer, even if no slacks were calculated

    - Enhanced the priority assignment tools
 
    - Do not allow viewing results if tool=parser

    - Added the "system_pip_behaviour" attribute to the model
      attributes to specify the priority inheritance behaviour:
      Strict, or POSIX.


Version 1.2.2
-------------

   This version fixes a bug in the offset-based analysis technique.
   Thanks to Ola Redell for catching it.

Version 1.2
-----------

   This version introduces support for analysis of linear systems with
   offsets, delays, or rate divisors. The tools supporting these
   features are the linear analysis tools (offset-based, and holistic)

   This version adds the following tools:

       Classic_RM_Analysis
       Varying_Priorities_Analysis

   This tool introduces a new format for the results, and a gui tool
   to view those results (gmastresults)

   Other changes introduced:

       Added the Permanent_Overridden_Scheduling_Parameters object,
       to represent the case in which an operation changes its
       priority to a given value, but does not return to the previous
       value at the end of the operation. This new part of the model
       is analyzable with the Varying_Priorities_Analysis tool.

       Added the processing resource slacks and the operation slacks.
